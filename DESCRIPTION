Description: Dedicated to the analysis of CGH (Comparative Genomic Hybridization) array profiles using segmentation models. 'cghseg' package is intended to detect breakpoints from CGH profiles. It can handle both single and multiple profiles analysis, to perform segmentation, normalization and calling. Methods for joint segmentation are described in : Picard and al. (2011), <doi:10.1093/biostatistics/kxq076>.
